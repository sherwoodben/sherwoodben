## About Me

Hello! I am a hobbyist programmer who mainly works with C++. I have a strong interest in graphics programming and game engine development.

Many see engine development as a futile effort or a waste of time. Others, including myself, see it as a great way to learn concepts and to practice applying knowledge. That being said, creating a game engine is _hard_. While I am always tinkering with glfw/glad/OpenGL, I don't have anything ready to present at this time.

What I do have, however, is smaller projects (tools, libraries, etc.) I have been working on to bolster my skills which might hopefully prove useful when it is time to actually build out a "real" engine instead of small "toys". I understand many (if not most) of the projects that will end up on this list have been done by others-- in fact their implementation is probably better! I'm not recommending _anyone_ use these projects for _anything_ meaningful. Realistically, these are learning exercises. This is just my hobby after all!

## Current Projects

Here are a list to the projects I currently host/maintain on github:

- [__bUnitTests__](https://github.com/sherwoodben/bUnitTests) - a single file "header" unit testing framework for C++ applications
- __bJSON__ [coming soon] - a JSON parsing/interpreting/encoding library for C++
